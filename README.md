**TIP CALCULATOR**



Tip Calculator is made up of three different programming languages, viz â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system is used to calculate the tip. Tip Calculator first lets the user input the cost of the meal, how great the service was and how many can split the bill. Then by pressing calculate, it returns how much each person should tip (at least 15% or 30%).
There is five type of services such as 5% terrible, 10% Bad, 15% It was good, 20% Good and 30% Outstanding.
All of the inputs are handled by the html and when the user clicks "calculate", the tip calculator file takes over and calculates the input that the user inserted, if not, a popup window will come up telling the user to put in parameters.
It is easy to use. It generates the tip amount from the total bill. It also divides the bill among a number of persons.
